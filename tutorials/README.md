Alpine Linux tutorias and howtos
=================================

**Where to start?** you will need check if you have enought Linux terminology knowledge, but 
_**if you are impatient and want an Alpine ready touse in 1 hour check **_ [.. this link: alpine XFCE desktop](alpine-tutorial-desktop-xfce4-fast-forward.md) 
if you want to avoid the explanations and just go all the way. For the wayland fashioned 
desktop try the guide [alpine tutorial desktop wayland](alpine-tutorial-desktop-wayland-try.md) 
but **Wayland is not recommended due several issues and X11 its more widelly working**.

## TUTORIALS AND HOWTOS

The **tutorials are hands-on docs** expected to try and achieve the goals described 
in each step, possibly with the help of a good example. The output in one step 
is the starting point for the following steps.

The **Howtos are smaller articles** explaining how to perform a particular task 
with Alpine Linux, that expects a minimal knowledge from reader to perform actions. 

The **Guides are fast documents** with only direct ways to do a particular task
with Alpine Linux, that expects a minimal knowledge from reader to perform actions.

    * At the point of 2022/v3.16 **[all the gvfs handlers are broken in Alpine](https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports/-/issues/14183)**
    * Alpine its not stable to use as desktop, developers [only solve issues to current or mayor version upgrades, not LTS due "community" nature of packages](https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports/-/issues/14182#note_262134)

## Acknowledges

**CONSIDERATIONS**: Please check the [Feature Differences OF ALPINE LINUX](../documents/README.md#feature-differences) 
but those are the main ones you should considering before usage of Alpine linux:

1. Alpine Linux **is designed for power users, with security and simplicity in mind**.
2. Alpine Linux **is not for newbies most knowed as new baby users or windosers**.
3. It is built around musl libc, not glibc, which means there might be incompatibilites with some packages
4. Its main utilities (coreutils) are derived from busybox and suckless, so all commands are pretty simplistic

**PREREQUISITES**: Please check the [alpine preparation requirements for you](alpine-newbie-prepare.md) 
but you can use linux using [termux](tutorial-alpine-in-phone.md) or [ish](tutorial-alpine-in-phone.md) on your phone.

* **Manners**, you will must have a vocation for reading and analysis.
* **Time**, you will need time, cos you will need to read a lot!
* **Computer**, you should **have a pc, or phone**, and must have a UNIX like operating system, like MAC/IOS or Androit/Linux
* **Internet**, and minimal bandwitch of internet network..
