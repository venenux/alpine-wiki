# Alpine Install: from a USB to any computer customized partitioning

**Overall description:** Alpine Installation from a official iso, 
dumpet to a usb source device media, and installed to a bare metal computer
no matter if include [UEFI](Alpine_and_UEFI.md) this will guide to 
installed to boot, **but using customized partiton layout**

Means you will **install Alpine in customized layout paritiont on PC computer from USB** media.

> **Warning** This method only works for most modern pc beyond 2016 and recents.

## Requirements

-   A usb stick to write the ISO source media file downloaded
-   In the new machine we need an USB port free and able to boot
-   In the new machine we need support for booting from USB devices
-   In the new machine we need at least 512Mb of RAM, but required 2Gb
    of RAM for desktop/graphical applications
-   In the new machine we need target media with at least 2G of hard
    disk, but required 10G for desktops
-   Will need to previously downloaded and burned the Source media ISO
    file from <https://alpinelinux.org/downloads/> into USB or CD/DVD

## Downloading the source medium to install

In this case, **your PC wil have [UEFI or must be beyond 2016's](Alpine_and_UEFI.md#where-i-will-find-bios-based-devices)** 
you will need **64-bit iso then**, the download URL will be:

`http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.20/releases/x86_64/alpine-extended-3.20.0-x86_64.iso`

**How to download usin Graphical browser**: point the web browser to 
that url and the download of the iso file will start. A file with **.iso** 
extension type, will be downloaded commonly into the Download directory.

**How to download usin Command line method**: in unix-like terminal (MAC/Linux) execute:
`cd $HOME;wget -c -t8 --no-check-certificate http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.20/releases/x86_64/alpine-extended-3.20.0-x86_64.iso`,
and unless the case of GUI, your **.iso** file wil be direclty in your home directory.

## Writing the source medium to your USB

Using [balena-etcher-electron](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to flash the USB 
drive from any system, its easy, simple and available for all OSs.

> ***Warning** this guide assume only one hard drive as `/dev/sda` and only one USB as `/dev/sdb`

* download the `program balena-etcher-electron` (there are portable versions)
* Run the program `balena-etcher-electron` as root in the graphical session
* Click "select image" icon, open the downloaded image file
* Plug the USB drive into the computer, it will automatically show as `sdb`
* After it balena-etcher-electronshows the USB as “sdb”, clickflash
* Wait a while and when finished, close the program
* Take out the USB and place it on the installation target computer in a port

> **Note** this method only works on recent MacOs 10.12+ or recent Linux 4.9+ installations

You can also made it manually, open your terminal program, move to the place 
directory where ISO downloaded are placed and `cp` to the USB device:

> umount /dev/sdb; cp alpine-extended-3.20.0-x86_64.iso /dev/sdb

## Booting the Alpine ISO disc

When the machine start, you must be sure to choose the right booting drive
(commonly named USB boot drive or USB hard disk), so the disc/iso will boot and after a
while a command line shell will show you:

> **Note** When starting Alpine it will ask for the login, just typing root and pressing enter allows you to start:

> **Warning** Tip: If your system is not configured to boot from a USB drive, it must be 
configured in the BIOS/UEFI, **ask/search to your vendor or technical support**, Toshiba 
computers need to hit F1 to choose boot medium, DELL must hit F11 to choose medium for 
example, and so and so

## Installing after boot up

> **Warning** if you do not download the extended ISO it may require internet.!!!

#### runing the setup script

After entering the root environment and gets the console prompt installation media, 
you must perform these commands, that will be in following order:

* prepare disk sizes, here we used boot partition up to 500 megs
* perpare swap sices, here we used swap partition up to 8 Gigs
* setup boot loader to grup (if wants lilo just change to lilo)
* and run "setup script" to configure and process instalation:

```
export BOOT_SIZE=500

export SWAP_SIZE=8164

export BOOTLOADER=grub

setup-alpine
```

After last command, it will start some questions, these are in the following order:

* keyboard and variant, example for Latin is `es` and after then `es-winkeys`
* hostname: just hit enter, it's the name of the computer, must be only strings.
* Network: select the `eth0` one that is the network cable and answer `dhcp`.
    * Network (again): only happends if you have wifi or second card.. must ignore it
    * DNS Options: It is recommended to use `8.8.8.8 ` and `none` for the domain
* Root: password for the administrative account, **take care and dont forgive it**
* Timezone: use UTC only for one OS, otherwise `America/Panama` or something similar
* Proxy Options: Use `none` if you are connecting directly to the Internet.
* NTP Options: Use `chrony` the packet already in the medium (extended).
* APK mirror: if you are over slow or no interent, type `Skip` or `none`
    * User: modern alpine releases allows user creation, skip by typing `no`
    * **WARNING** edit `/etc/apk/respositories` and **enable community** ones!
* SSH Options: Use `openssh` the package that already comes in the medium (extended).
    * Root allow: here you must type `yes` because we do not setup user yet!
    * SSH key: just type here `none`
* Disk Options: Use `none` cos we will use custom disk layout partition setup.
    * Config store: here just type `none` cos we don not need this in future
    * APK cache: just use default we will use extended iso or dont care

#### Format Patitions and disk layout

We are **configuring a UEFI capable system** so we need to setup a **minimal 
layout of three or more partionts**, following are the mandatory ones:

| Mount point | Partition    | Partition type Purpose      | Minimum size | Formats |
|-------------|--------------|-----------------------------|--------------|---------|
| /boot/efi ? | /dev/<disk>1 | GPT UEFI Boot partition     | 260 MiB      | eufat |
| none        | /dev/<disk>2 | Linux swap memory           | 2Gb          | swap |
| /           | /dev/<disk>3 | Alpine Linux root system OS | 32 GiB       | btreefs,ext2/3/4,xfs |

For more info about check [../alpine/requirementes.md](../alpine/requirementes.md) 
and the document [../alpine/alpine-boot-uefi-bios.md](../alpine/alpine-boot-uefi-bios.md).

> **Warning** edit `/etc/apk/respositories` and **enable community repositories**!

Here **we will assume you already partitioned the disk, if not** this part will 
be only a quick steps using fdisk and assuming your ssd/hdd is `/dev/sda` so 
then using same medium running alpine linux you can use fdisk:

* `fdisk /dev/sda`; **warning** will erase entire disk!
* hit `d` and then enter how many times need until said: `no partition is defined..`
* hit `n`+enter and then hit `1`+enter, and then enter to use default first sector
* next for last sector of partiton write `+500M` and hit enter
* if previously have partitions will ask for removal of signature, hit `Y`+enter
* now second partiton: hit `n`+enter and then hit `2`+enter and use first default
* for last sector of second partition write `+16G` (or at least 4G) and enter
* if previously have partitions will ask for removal of signature, hit `Y`+enter
* now thirth partiton: hit `n`+enter and then hit `3`+enter and use first default
* for last sector of second partition write `+160G` (or at least 80G) and enter
* if previously have partitions will ask for removal of signature, hit `Y`+enter
* now hit `t`+enter and then hit `1`+enter and then hit `1`+enter
* now hit `t`+enter and then hit `2`+enter and then hit `19`+enter
* now hit `t`+enter and then hit `3`+enter and then hit `20`+enter
* now hit `w` and you will have 3 partitons, first: EFI, second: SWAP and root

After answering `sys` to the questions about the drive, and since there will only 
be one drive, answering `sda` (if options shows to you) on which drive to use, 
this will create and leave your hard drive as follows:

* `/dev/sda1` as BOOT in 500Mb in `/boot`
* `/dev/sda2` as SWAP in 16Gb (or at least 4 gigs)
* `/dev/sda3` as ROOT in 160Gb in `/` (approximately or rest of space available)

So now we must format partitions so lest run those commands from alpine running 
medium, be carefully that you must enabled the community repositories previously:

```
apk add e2fsprogs dosfstools

mkfs.vfat -n EFI /dev/sda1

mkswap -L SWAP /dev/sda2

mkfs.ext4 -b 1024 -m 1 -L ROOT /dev/sda3
```

#### Setup and install to customized partition layout disk

This part will assume the following layout to property work, mounted 
in the following order as mandatory:

* `/dev/sda3` as ROOT on `/target` with format EXT4 and 1024 sector size
* `/dev/sda1` as BOOT in `/target/boot` with format of EFIFAT
* `/dev/sda2` as SWAP with a previous format 

So then lest install customized partioned disk with alpine:

> **Warning** edit `/etc/apk/respositories` and **enable community repositories**!

```
apk add grub-efi arch-install-scripts coreutils os-prober

mkdir -p /target

mount -t ext4 /dev/sda3 /target

mkdir -p /target/boot

mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 /target/boot

mkdir -p /target/boot/efi

export BOOTLOADER=grub

export KERNELOPTS=" acpi_enforce_resources=lax iomem=relaxed vsyscall=emulated "

setup-disk -m sys /target

apk del syslinux

apk add grub grub-bios

grub-install --compress=no --boot-directory=/target/boot /dev/sda

cat > /target/etc/default/grub << EOF
GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR="Alpine"
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="rootfstype=ext4 modules=sd-mod,usb-storage,ext4 $KERNELOPTS"
GRUB_TIMEOUT=6
GRUB_DISABLE_SUBMENU=y
EOF
cp -f /target/etc/default/grub /etc/default/grub

mount /dev/ /target/dev/--bind

mount /proc/ /target/proc/--bind

chroot /target

grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

exit

umount /target/proc

umount /target/dev

umount /target/boot

umount /target

reboot
```

## NOTES: offline mode

If you cannot setup a internet connection you cannot install Alpine linux, 
unless you used 64bit intel/amd and "extended" iso install media. Most of 
the packages need to setup this procedure are not included in standard images, 
specially those for ARM devices like RasberryPi ones becouse WIFi setup.

## Finishing the installation

After all of the scripts in the setup end, the "reboot" message will not 
happens and just type "reboot" and press enter, remove the boot media and newly
installed system will be booted.

**You cannot see a graphical window system? take it easy** and get
calmed down.. in Alpine all are made by the right way.. so **if user
need a desktop.. user can install a desktop**

#### The wifi setup after install

Please follow the guide [alpine-tutorial-wifi-routering.md](alpine-tutorial-wifi-routering.md), 
you will need to download the needed packages manually from another device 
and then but it on the installed Alpine computer using USBstorage external device.

#### Recommendations

* If you setup SSD disk.. you must tune up to downwrite or reduce writting process
* Next to graphical setup can be done using our tutorials (check the "See also" section at the end)

## How to use this guide

This guide is for install process, many parts will need you understand minimal 
knowledge of linux.

This guide assumed you have a serial port allowed in the targeted computer, also 
its important you shuold understand the way of the configuration in this guide.

> **Warning**  Some Linux or/and Mac terminals have security cut/paste locks, so 
if you paste, the first line will be preceded by garbage, check always the first char of your paste.

Each portion of monospaced text means you must run it on the console, those lines 
junted can be performed and paste as one command, separate lines canont be run 
in bach mode.. so eacho separate line must be run alonside and wait output!
