# alpine_wiki

This is a markdown based effort to provide non-minimalist documentation 
for a minimalist operating system named [Alpine Linux](alpine/about.md), 
a Linux distribution [with base on musl libc](alpine/base-with-muslc-and-busybox.md#base-with-muslc) 
and [defaults commands to Busybox](alpine/base-with-muslc-and-busybox.md#defaults-to-busybox), 
with option to change that!

**Where to start? Check the next section.** Ok but if you are impatient and 
want an Alpine ready touse in 4 hours, you have two options:

1. [.. this link...](newbie/alpine-newbie-xfce-desktop.md) a single explanatory article that installs a complete desktop, too much text, then;
2. [.. use this link...](tutorials/alpine-tutorial-desktop-xfce4-fast-forward.md) but if you want to avoid the explanations and just go all the way... use this other one that is multilanguage

### Tutorials and Docs

1. [Newbies](documents/README.md), not mandatory but recommended you start to read the [Newbies documentation](documents/README.md).
2. [Tutorials](tutorials/README.md), for impatients if you have computer or only a phone, read the [Tutorials](tutorials/README.md)
