Termus's wiki said: **that you avoid YouTube tutorials, especially related to hacking. There a lot of clickbait targeted at inexperienced users**.

# alpine_wiki

This is a markdown-based effort to provide a non-minimalist documentation 
for the minimalist operating system [Alpine Linux](alpine/about.md);
a Linux distribution based upon the [Musl LibC](alpine/base-with-muslc-and-busybox.md#base-with-muslc) 
and defaults commands to [Busybox](alpine/base-with-muslc-and-busybox.md#defaults-to-busybox)
but not limited to only those options.
